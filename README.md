# stupid_cat_game

I taught a high school level intro computer science class last year. 

I'd much rather be teaching them about finite state machines or why bubble sort sucks but oh no no no, "we want to make games!!!".

This is the python game I made as a template to teach the class.

The premise of the game is that hello kitty has a gun and needs to kill hitler. I thought this was cool because I like hello kitty and I hate hitler.

Not my best work, it's for sure not winning any softwear design awards. The OOP stuff is a bit brutal, but hey it gets the job done!!
